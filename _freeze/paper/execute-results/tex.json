We performed t-tests and linear regression analysis to\n  evaluate differences. Treatment group exhibited significantly elevated values\n  compared to control group.\n---\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nUnderstanding differences between experimental conditions is fundamental to scientific research.\nThis analysis compares measurements collected from control and treatment groups to evaluate whether\nthe experimental intervention produces measurable changes. We hypothesized that the treatment would\nresult in elevated measurements compared to controls.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Design and Data\n\nWe collected measurements from both control and treatment groups on two separate dates\n(January 15 and January 20, 2024). A total of 20 observations were recorded (10 per group,\nwith measurements repeated across two dates). One measurement in the control group was excluded\ndue to missing data.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nWe employed two complementary approaches to evaluate group differences:\n\n1. **T-test**: A two-sample t-test compared mean values between groups, with statistical\n   significance assessed at α = 0.05.\n\n2. **Linear regression**: A simple linear model with group as the predictor was fit to the data\n   to quantify the magnitude of the treatment effect.\n\n## Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe treatment group showed consistently higher measurements compared to controls:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Summary statistics by group\n\ngroup         n    mean     sd    min    max\n----------  ---  ------  -----  -----  -----\nControl       9   24.22   0.78   23.1   25.3\nTreatment    10   29.03   0.77   27.9   30.2\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMean values were 24.22\nfor the control group and 29.03\nfor the treatment group, representing a difference of\n4.81 units.\n\n### Statistical Tests\n\nThe t-test comparing groups revealed a significant difference\n(*t* = -13.556,\n*p* = 0).\nThe linear regression model confirmed this finding, with the treatment effect coefficient\nof 4.808 units.\n\n### Visualizations\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/boxplot.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/timeseries.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 1** displays the distribution of measurements by group, illustrating the separation\nbetween control and treatment responses. Individual points are overlaid on the boxplots to show\ndata density. **Figure 2** shows how mean values changed over the measurement dates, with\nboth groups maintaining consistent differences across time points.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur analysis provides strong evidence that the treatment significantly increases measured values\ncompared to controls. The effect is both statistically significant and practically meaningful,\nwith treatment values approximately 5 units higher than controls on average.\n\nThe consistency of this effect across two measurement dates suggests a robust treatment response\nrather than a transient effect. These findings align with the theoretical expectation that the\ntreatment would produce elevated measurements and support the efficacy of the intervention.\n\nFuture work should investigate the mechanism underlying this treatment effect and explore dose-response\nrelationships to optimize the intervention.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates a clear and statistically significant difference between control and treatment\ngroups, with the treatment producing elevated measurements. The results provide evidence supporting the\neffectiveness of the experimental intervention.\n\n## References\n",
